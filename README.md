ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset â€“ Power BI Analysis

I created this project to analyze the Titanic dataset in Power BI. The goal was to understand passenger details and survival patterns through interactive dashboards and visuals.

What this project includes:-

Data cleaning and preparation in Power BI

KPIs showing total passengers, survivors, and overall survival rate

Charts for passenger class, gender, age, and embarkation points

Visual comparisons of survival across different categories

A simple, interactive dashboard for exploring the data

Tools Used:-

Power BI for data modeling and dashboard design

Titanic dataset (classic dataset for analysis projects)

Key Takeaways:-

Survival chances were higher for women and children

First-class passengers had better survival rates compared to lower classes

Fare and embarkation point influenced survival distribution


Note:-

This project was a good practice to apply Power BI features like measures, charts, filters, and storytelling through data.
